    "In using Support Vector Machines with a linear classified (which we will try first) the data must be linear separable. That means each of the feature to feature mappings must present the actual class that is clearly separated by a linear plane. While SVM with Radial Bias Function (RBF) can accomodate non-linear data we will look towards taking our Data and modifying it for easier analysis.\n",
