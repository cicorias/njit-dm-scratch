In the video/slides for Module2B - on slide 5 (video about 11:00 inwards) the algorithm parameter for support level of ">= 20%" is mentioned, however, should this be just ">" (greater than)?

I'm asking as in the sample data used, Item "E" appears 1/5 of the time, and that is 20%, which is ">= 20%"...
